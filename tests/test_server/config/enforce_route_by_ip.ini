; Enforce Route By source IP or hostname 
;for a certain user 
; This plugin provides a source ip based "authentication" for clients which are not 
; able to authenticate themselves to authentication required MTA.
; The idea is to authenticate incoming anonymous connections by IP address and enforce mail_from and rcpt_to policies 
; based on client's IP address.

; If strict_mode is set to 'no' plugin will reject connection requests other than listed here.
; open_relay=yes will take care of connection requests originating from IP addresses listed under [domain] section and
; leave other requests untouched.
; default is no
open_relay=no

; For each mail_from domain a section should be created which contains the email and IP address 
; assignments. The email name should be without domain part, and IP addresses have to be separated
; by comma. IP addresses can refer to subnets too with the network notation (eg. 10.1.0.0/16).
;
; Example:
;
; [mycompany.com] 
; no-reply=10.4.10.2, 10.4.11.0/24
; firewall=10.4.10.1
; 
; [myothercompany.com]
; no-reply@myothercompany.com=192.168.1.1
[mail_from]
127.0.0.1=sender1@example.com

; Under rcpt_to section list the allowed rcpt_to email addresses or domains. If no domain or email
; address is listed every receipt is allowed.
[rcpt_to]
sender1@example.com=example.com
