<h2>A Haraka plugin for enforcing email route by hostname</h2>
<p>This plugin provides a source ip based "authentication" for clients which are not able to authenticate themselves to MTA.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Certain applications (eg. SAP) are not able to send emails with authentication. In this case to avoid setting up open relay one would have to allow mail receipt by source IP. While this option is available even on Microsoft Exchange (restrict mail connector access by source IP), it is not possible to enforce certain sender on the receipt side. That means, (eg.) SAP application server can send email in anyone's name. </p>
<p>Since email communication within enterprise is highly trusted that is not a good idea: an attacker breaking into SAP application server can impersonate anyone within the domain. Too bad. </p>
<p>There is two option: elevate SAP server's trust level to that of Active Directory's or create a controlled mail sending facility. This plugin is to solve this problem.</p>
<h2>Example setup</h2>
<p>Suppose we have two servers (server1 and server2) both hosting services not able to authenticate against AD. 
Server1 has to send emails from noreply-app@example.com to example.com while server2 has to send 
emails from nessus@example.com or syslog@example.com to infosec@example.com. The network setup is like this:</p>
<pre><code>server1 (192.168.100.1) ------+
                              |----&gt; haraka (192.168.100.200) ----&gt; AD (192.168.10.10)
server2 (192.168.100.2) ------+
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To set up haraka for the example setup you should do the following:</p>
<h4>Create a default haraka setup with</h4>
<pre><code>haraka -i /path/to/harakatest
</code></pre>
<h4>Edit plugins file in harakatest/config directory</h4>
<pre><code>queue/smtp_proxy
tls
enforce_route_by_ip
</code></pre>
<h4>Edit smtp_proxy.ini file in harakatest/config directory</h4>
<pre><code>host=192.168.10.10
port=25
enable_tls=1
[auth]
type=plain
user=&lt;your Active Directory user name&gt;
pass=&lt;your password&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4>Edit enforce<em>route</em>by_ip.ini file in harakatest/config directory</h4>
<pre><code>[mail_from]
192.168.100.1=noreply-app@example.com
192.168.100.2=nessus@example.com, syslog@example.com

[rcpt_to]
noreply-app@example.com=example.com
nessus@example.com=infosec@example.com
syslog@example.com=infosec@example.com
</code></pre>
<p>By setting <code>open_relay=no</code> in <code>enforce_route_by_ip.ini</code> the plugin will allow email exchanges for sources which are not configured. It is an optional unsafe mode. The strict mode is set to yes be default, of course.</p>
<p><code>any</code> is a special sender, which means any email addresses is accepted from given host. For <code>any</code> send one can define rcpt<em>to rules. In the following example from host 192.168.100.1 any mail</em>from address is accepted to gmail.com domain.
    [mail<em>from]
    192.168.100.1=any
    [rcpt</em>to]
    any=gmail.com</p>
